# Proxy

> H3 proxy utilities.

### `fetchWithEvent(event, url, init?)`

Make a fetch request with the event's context and headers.

If the `url` starts with `/`, the request is dispatched internally via `event.app.fetch()` (sub-request) and never leaves the process.

**Security:** Never pass unsanitized user input as the `url`. Callers are responsible for validating and restricting the URL.

### `getProxyRequestHeaders(event)`

Get the request headers object without headers known to cause issues when proxying.

### `proxy(event, target, opts)`

Make a proxy request to a target URL and send the response back to the client.

If the `target` starts with `/`, the request is dispatched internally via `event.app.fetch()` (sub-request) and never leaves the process. This bypasses any external security layer (reverse proxy auth, IP allowlisting, mTLS).

**Security:** Never pass unsanitized user input as the `target`. Callers are responsible for validating and restricting the target URL (e.g. allowlisting hosts, blocking internal paths, enforcing protocol).

### `proxyRequest(event, target, opts)`

Proxy the incoming request to a target URL.

If the `target` starts with `/`, the request is handled internally by the app router via `event.app.fetch()` instead of making an external HTTP request.

**Security:** Never pass unsanitized user input as the `target`. Callers are responsible for validating and restricting the target URL (e.g. allowlisting hosts, blocking internal paths, enforcing protocol). Consider using `bodyLimit()` middleware to prevent large request bodies from consuming excessive resources when proxying untrusted input.
